# Project timeline

Rationale: This document aims to work backwards from the targeted time of completion
to build out a timeline and get an impression of how quickly things need to move.

## Deadline

As I can't find a more specific deadline I'm assuming the end of the lecture period
to be the end of the project. According to [this website](https://www.tu.berlin/studierendensekretariat/fristen-termine/) that would be 2022-07-23.

## Deliverables

- GitHub repo that contains code fulfilling the goals defined in [description.md](./description.md)
- Project Report of 60 pages
