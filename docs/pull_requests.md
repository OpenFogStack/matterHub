# Process for pull requests

This document aims to describe how we do pull requests for matterHub.

## As the Author

1. Write code on a feature branch
2. Create a Draft PR as soon as you push something
3. Assign a reviewer whenever you want a review (This can be before the code is ready to merge)
    1. If your reviewer requests changes, do them or argue why they are not required
    2. Don't forget to re-request the review, if you are ready for a second round
4. Once your code is ready for merge/final review, mark the PR by removing the draft
5. If you have the approval of a reviewer and adressed all comments you are free to merge

## As a reviewer

1. Try to do your reviews as soon as possible, as your team member might be blocked on your review
2. If you want to request concrete changes, please use the suggestions feature
3. For comments don't _have_ to be adressed. please use the prefix `nit:` or `nitpick:`
4. Feel free to merge a non-draft PR, when you approve it
